        <p>
          Our affinity diagram consists of five groups: Prioritization, App Elements, User Feedback, Timing, and Restaraunt Ideas. Prioritization relates to the overall decision-making process and ranking system that the app utilizes. App elements include features that would help smooth the process of getting food. User feedback consists of gathering suggestions that could help improve the system later down the line. Timing consists of ideas that relate to the timing of orders and processes within the system. Lastly, Restaurant Ideas includes features that can be added into the restaurant that will improve the structure and operation.
